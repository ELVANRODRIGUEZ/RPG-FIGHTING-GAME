# **RPG FIGHTING GAME**

**DESCRIPTION**

This is a RPG simple fighting game. The catch of this project was more the visual and sound effects added to the interface rather than the functionality, which is as simple as having to press the 'A' button to start attacking the opponent. Once attacking and defender characters are chosen, the user will have to defeat all characters to win. As a new character comes forward, a lower chance to hurt him/her will the user have due to a function that recalculates that chance. Additionally, either a Street Fighter (Guile theme) or a KOF (Terry Bogard KOF '95 theme) will be played depending on the character the user selects as defender.
